	Software ? 
			System  , application , web application ,android application , web site
			e.g  SAP , Tally , outlook , gmail, flipcart , amazone , whataspp , careercenter , notpad ,,alarm , 
	
	set of program , perticular task/purpose 
	
	How software are developed ?
		language/coding , discussion , requirements , UI/UX , time ,

	SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 
		1. Requirements 
		2. Analysis
		3. Desgining
		4. Implementaion/Coding
		5. Testing
		6. Mantainance

22th Sep
	1. Requirements -->  client gives us requirements . 
				e.g student , faculty , admin ,
					registration , login ,reports 
					student - attendance , result 
	2. Analysis --> each requirement is analysed 
				registration - fileds , who , 
				atatndance - login must be there , registrater 
			system flow , connectivity 
	3. Designing ---> looks , how it looks , UI/UX 
				pages/form desining 
	4. implementation --> coding ,logic are developed 
	5. Testing --> 	Accouring to requirements application working or not,
			To verify , validate
	6. Maintainance --> change ,update , new functionality 
				longest phares of life cycle
	
	SLDC Models 
			1. Sequential Model - Waterfall model , V Model 
			2. Iterative Model - Agile Model , Spiral Model , Incremental Model	

		
	Waterfall Model --> each pahare are in sequnece .And you can not go back .
				Requirements are fixed /Project is small /
	
	V Model ---> verification/Validation model 
			1. Business Requirements - client will gives us 
			2. System requirements - system requirements 
			3. Technical Specification/High Level - Overall structure of applcation
			4. Program specification/Low level - percular modul;e/program requirement/design 	
			Coding - Actual implentations  , connecting 

			Unit Test - Program/module/unit testing,Testing of percular program/module/unit/coponenet
			2. Interation Test - when 2 modules are connected and testing to gether 
			3. System test - To test as whole system with hardwares/network 
			4. Acceptance test - when client check requiremetns are fulfilled or not

		Verfication/Validation

			Which requirement is more important ?
			Both are equally important 

		
			Fields of SRS --- scope , details of requirments , functional - non functional , technology 

	Lab task --> SRS of any social media 
	
--> Usecase diagram  -- mapping user with  activity
			admin can update order
			admin manage product
			user can track order
