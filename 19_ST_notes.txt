	SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 
		1. Requirements 
		2. Analysis
		3. Desgining
		4. Implementaion/Coding
		5. Testing
		6. Mantainance

22th Sep
	1. Requirements -->  client gives us requirements . 
				e.g student , faculty , admin ,
					registration , login ,reports 
					student - attendance , result 
	2. Analysis --> each requirement is analysed 
				registration - fileds , who , 
				atatndance - login must be there , registrater 
			system flow , connectivity 
	3. Designing ---> looks , how it looks , UI/UX 
				pages/form desining 
	4. implementation --> coding ,logic are developed 
	5. Testing --> 	Accouring to requirements application working or not,
			To verify , validate
	6. Maintainance --> change ,update , new functionality 
				longest phares of life cycle
	
	SLDC Models 
			1. Sequential Model - Waterfall model , V Model 
			2. Iterative Model - Agile Model , Spiral Model , Incremental Model	

		
	Waterfall Model --> each pahare are in sequnece .And you can not go back .
				Requirements are fixed /Project is small /
	
	V Model ---> verification/Validation model 
			1. Business Requirements - client will gives us 
			2. System requirements - system requirements 
			3. Technical Specification/High Level - Overall structure of applcation
			4. Program specification/Low level - percular modul;e/program requirement/design 	
			Coding - Actual implentations  , connecting 

			Unit Test - Program/module/unit testing,Testing of percular program/module/unit/coponenet
			2. Interation Test - when 2 modules are connected and testing to gether 
			3. System test - To test as whole system with hardwares/network 
			4. Acceptance test - when client check requiremetns are fulfilled or not

	Lab task --> use case doagram for Social Media
	
	Software Architechture ?

1st Oct

SRS document   --- Detailed of projects purpose,scope,tech stack, functional , non functional ,module description , use classes

usecase  diagram --mapping user to activity ,which activity done by whom
			Actors --Librarian , student ,visitor 
			Activies -- book issue , search books , return book , update book , 


Software Architecture  -- Overall porject structure 
			Librarian 		Student
			Book Issues		Browse Book
			Book Return 		issue Book
			Fine	

What is Testing  ???
 		actual vs expected result
		client requirement meet , all functionalties are working fine
		
		--evaluating & verifying process
		 involes executing software intent to find bugs 
		covers functional and non functional requirements
		

Testing Objectives ?
		product works ,
		error free product
		
		finding error
		Prevention error
		fulfill requirement
		improve quality
		user satishfaction

When we can start ? 
	Testing should be start as early as possible
	when we got the requirement --- Test planing , test case design , static testing (without executing software - review of document)


When to stop ?
	Testing is never ending process 

Testing principle ---? Rules 
	1. Absence of erro fallacy (Software have no defect but not fulflling requirement )
	2. Exhasting testing ( mobile no -- 5/7/10/20 each and every combination is not possible to test -use risk and priority based testing)
	3. Testing shows presence of defect ( 
	4. Defect Clustering (Small module may have more defect )
	5. Early Testing 
	6.pastiside paradox  ( Review and Revised test cases)
	7. Testing is context dependent (Banking/Social Media should be test differently)
	
3rd Oct
	What is ST?
	When to start?
	When to Stop?
	Principles ...
	
	-- Verify evaluating defect of product/software for given requirment
	--Working of software 
	Functional and non functional ---> What system does - functionality/features of application
					NF - How system does	- other then functionality like perforamnce,load,strees , compatiblity ,usability

	When to start/stop? As early as possible when we get requuirremnt
				meet deadline,exit creitera,test coverage , defect fix, buisness dicision
		
	Priciple - 
		early testing
		Testing context dependent
		error falacy
		Pastiside paradox
		Defect clusting
		Testing shows presence of defect
		Exhausting Testing

	Why Testing?
		Quality
		To completeness and correctness

	OOPS - 
		procedure oriented  - procedure/function (c)
		Object oriented  - object (java,python ,c++)

		1. class 	-	Blueprint / collection of object / real entity /state-behaviour/data members-member function
					Human is class , hands,legs,eyes...speak-eat-listen 
					Car is class , color,price,engine...drive
 
		2. object	-	real entity , it is type of class
					dharmishtha is Human 
					Vishant is Human 
					Baleno is Car
					Creta is Car

		3. Inheritance	-	Parent - child Property of one class can use property of another classs
					Person - name,age,address ....getDetails,display
					Employee - name,age,address,id,salary,department
					Person in employee class - reusablity 
					Employee is Person
					
					Vehical - type,c_name,price,engine,color - details
					Car - type,c_name,price,engine , wheels 
					Scooter - type,c_name,price,engine
	 				
					Car is Vehical
					schooter is Vehical 


		4. Polymorphisum
					Ability to take more then one form - many form 
					Maitri is student,daughter,employee
					addition is of 2 numbers , 3 numbers n numbers , numeric , decmial 

				
		5. Encapsulation	wraping of data and functions to gather into single unit (class)
					data private ,methods public 			

		6. Abstraction    showing essentials,hiding other details 
					SBI - interest

SQL		practise - tables , data store , Structure Query Language , Manipulations of data
		Database testing 
		
		Database ? To store data -Manipulation 
		DBMS - Database management System  - to manage your data -manipulate - thru sql 
		RDBMS - Relation DBMS - tables are related 
		Tools - RDBMS - eg -  MySQL , ms-access , SQL server ,

2 Module - Manual Testing 
	
	Testing ? - develop thayu hoy testing 
			  - To check whther it's working properly or not

			-Process , evaluate , check software as expected work ?
			-not Single activity
			- bugs , error , missing requirements 
			- To check software to find indenend requirement ,bugs errors 
			- ensure meets functional - non functional requirement 
				functional requirements - features/functionality of application 
				non-functional requimrenent - apart from function it's response time,security , performance ,easy to use 
				Both are equally important

Testing objectives :- 
					Bug find 
					requirement fulfill
					Quality product

When to start testing ?
			As early as possible 
			when requiremens are thr 
			designing test scenario , test cases 

when to stop ?

7 key Principle of Testing - guidelines 
	1. Context Dependent 
	2. Absence of error fallacy 
	3. Testing shows presence of defect
	4. Pasticide paradox - review - revised test cases periodically 
	5. Defect Clusting  - group - most of defects are in group and it may be in small module so you have test all module equally 
	6. Early Testing - As earlky as possible , review requirements - test cases 
	7. Exhaustive testing is impossible  - each and every combination of input is not possible , Risk based

Error - Bug -defect - Failure


Error - Human mistack - at time of software developmemnt - Developer , designer , tester 
defect - tester finds - diffrence between exptected and actual result - tester during testing - 
Bug - End user - during execution - system behave unexptectedly
Failure - system crash - during execution-production -

Which testing you heard about : Functional , Regression , System ,UI/UX , Performance , integration , Business flow , End-to -End testing , Corner test cases , black box,white box,gray box

Test Levels : V Model 
1. Unit testing	-	Generally Developer does, The module/program/componenet developed by developers and 			module/program/componenet - 	checked by developer .
								Some tools/library/framework 
								Checking componenets seprately.
								


2. Integration Testing		- we are integreating 2 modules and checking wherether they are working together it's integration testing
							- Developers/Tester 
							1. Componenets integration Testing  - Unit combine/integrating
							2. System Integration testing  - system combine and we checked as they are working to 									gather or not After System testing we are doing system integration testing.


							Top -down approach - if upper module complete and lower is not then we are creating stub (dummay module) to check with upper module 
							Botton up approach - if if upper mdule is not completed so we are creating driver/dummy to check bottom module 


3. System Testing		- 	Whole system / all componenets are integrated and communicated/working properly or not.
							Indendent tester ,QA
							Functional - non functional testing 

4. Acceptanec testing	-	Where system is accepatable or not. all requirements are matched/fulfill
							acceptable criteria should be matched.

Scenario Based Interview Questions 
2. A customer is unable to add products to the cart. What could be the cause, and how would you verify it?

3. The payment gateway is not working, and the customer cannot make a purchase. How would you investigate and resolve the issue?

4. The product page is not loading correctly for certain customers. What steps would you take to diagnose this?


5. A customer reports that they are seeing outdated product prices. How would you go about diagnosing and fixing this?

6. A customer reports that the website is very slow while browsing certain categories. What kind of performance testing or diagnostics would you perform?

7. A user is reporting an issue with their address not being accepted during checkout. How would you troubleshoot this?

8. A customer is unable to find a specific product on the website despite it being available in the backend. What steps would you take to investigate?

9. A customer is complaining that they received an incorrect product or a damaged item. How would you approach troubleshooting this issue?
